BYOB API provides access to information about Colorado breweries and beers with endpoints for GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. This API follows [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles and uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) for authentication and authorization. 

The API contains two tables with access to `breweries` and `beers` and returns all data in JSON format. 

| **Breweries**        | **Beers**            |
| :------------------: | :------------------: |
| Name                 | Name                 |
| Location             | Type                 |
| Beer Count           | Brewery              |
| Year                 | Brewery ID           |
